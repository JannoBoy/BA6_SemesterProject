      was built 1899 by sculptor Edmund Renard and his son, based on a poem by August
      Kopisch (1799-1853) called \u201CDie Heinzelm\xE4nnchen zu K\xF6ln!\u201D"

  - text: "You probably already know about Gnomes and Goblins. Heinzelm\xE4nnchen
      are similar looking, but way more diligent.   Let me tell you about the Heinzelm\xE4nnchen
      Tale: At night, when everyone is asleep, the Heinzelm\xE4nnchen, helpful spirits
      that live in peoples\u2019 homes, take over the work the humans could not fulfill. 
      Would be quite cool to have someone help you with your chores QUAK "

  - text: "Look closely at the stone reliefs! Looking from left to right, the fountain
      reliefs visualize each verse of the Heinzelm\xE4nnchen Poem. Can you guess
      the four different occupations that the Heinzelm\xE4nnchen help with?"

  - text: "When looking at the Heinzelm\xE4nnchen figures, as well as the four emblems
      in between, we can find the occupations of Craftsman,Baker, Butcher and Tailor.
      Did you guess it correctly? Nice! You have a great eye for details."

  - text: "See the statue of that woman on top of the fountain? That is the tailor\u2019s
      wife from the poem. She dispersed a range of peas, resulting in the Heinzelm\xE4nnchen
      to slip and fall down the stairs. How mean!"
